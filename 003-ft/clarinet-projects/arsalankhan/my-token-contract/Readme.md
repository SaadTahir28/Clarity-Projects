# OmegaCoins
OmegaCoins(OMC) is a fungible token which implements sip-010-trait standard, it implements all the functions provided by sip-011 trait to be fully compatible with the stacks blockchain. 100 OMC tokens will be minted to the Token Owner once the FT is deployed.

## Omega-Contract Definition
I have created a test contract through which you can sell/buy OmegaCoin tokens by exchanging it with your STX tokens. Omega-Contract is defined in the file "omega-contract.clar". The omega-contract deployer can only sell and transfer its minted OmegaCoins to the omega-contract and then anyone can get these Omegacoin tokens by transfering STX token to the contract deployer and in return he/she will get OmegaCoin tokens. The exchange rate is (1 OMC = 1000 uSTX). e.g in order to get 1 OMC token, you have to transfer 1000 mSTX. Steps to get OMC tokens are as follows:
