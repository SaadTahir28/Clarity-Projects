## Assignment: 3 Fungible Tokens

The game is that there are managers that can send tokens to its players as reward. If the player scores a goal, the reward of 1000000 tokens is sent to him. If the player doesn't score a goal, 1000 tokens are burned from his account. The players can then use those tokens and transfer between themselves or convert them. They can also see the token information as well. Only the managers are responsible of giving or destroying the tokens. For now, my manager will only be the contract deployer.
